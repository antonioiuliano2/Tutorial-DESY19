# Machine Learning preparation and analysis codes

This folder contains the routine designed by Maria De Luca during her Master Thesis.

A dataset containing the base-tracks for shower candidate is produced, then provided as input to a Random Forest classifier.

The scripts need to be launched in the following order (Concat_dataframe.py is launched twice):

1. Proiezioni.py

2. Inizio_sciame.py

3. Rect.py

4. Rect_crescenti.py

5. Taglio_Theta.py

6. Concat_dataframe.py

7. Ricerca_new.py

8. Concat_dataframe.py

9. Random_Forest_Ishower.py

There are two versions, one for simulation csv and the other for data csv
